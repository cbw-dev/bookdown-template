"],["cross.html", "2 Cross-references 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 2.2 Captioned figures and tables", " 2 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 2.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2024) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
